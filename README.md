<h1>DISTL Report </h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Principal author of a comprehensive data-driven’ report on the Swenson College of Science and Engineering’s retention rates, graduation rates, etc., including a SWOT analysis with an ROI from researched based solutions. This required a substantial amount of data sourcing and processing from both internal and external sources, multivariate analyses, and enhanced return-on-investment metrics based on advanced statistical modeling techniques. 

The largest skill check during this project was not the actual data analysis, but the aggregation of everything in a single professional, visually attactive, clear yet detailed document. I'll mention that whis was done while I was on summer vacation and is serving as the foundation and starting point for large collaborative external grant applications.
